Do you like running the latest bleeding edge builds? Well we have the best thing for you since sliced bread. Our Jenkins Build Server, reachable at <http://jenkins.chiorichan.com/job/ChioriWebServer/>. Builds are automatically compiled with each GIT push.

We recommend turning it off for production environments.
