# Groovy API
Chiori-chan's Web Server utilizes a proprietary API based on the PHP API for ease of use. The primary scripting language is Groovy and supports Groovy Server Pages (GSP), which much like PHP allows a developer can place groovy coode within code blocks starting  with `<%` and ending with `%>`.

    You are running <% getProduct() %> <% getVersion() %>
