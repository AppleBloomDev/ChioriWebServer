 * 2. License Grants and Conditions
 *
 * 2.1. Grants
 *

 *      non-exclusive license:
 *
 *      a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
 *         Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
 *         modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
 *         Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
 *         part of a Larger Work; and

 *      b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
 *         sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
 *         or its Contributor Version.
 *
 * 2.2. Effective Date
 *
 *      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
 *      effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
 *      such Contribution.
 *
 * 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 *
 *      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
 *      License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
 *      or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
 *      2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
 *
 *      a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
 *
 *      b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
 *         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
 *         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
 *         Version); or
 *
 *      c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
 *         Contributions.
 *
 *      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
 *      logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
 *      notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 *
 * 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 *
 *      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 *      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
 *      (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
 *      under the terms of Section 3.3).
 *
 * 2.5. Representation
 *
 *      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
 *      are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
 *      rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 *
 * 2.6. Fair Use
 *
 *      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
 *      copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
 *
 * 2.7. Conditions
 *
 *      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
 *      Section 2.1.
 *
 *
 * 3. Responsibilities
 *
 * 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 *
 *      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 *      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
 *      terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
 *      of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
 *      they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
 *      restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
 *
 * 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 *
 *      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 *
 *      a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
 *         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
 *         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
 *         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
 *         of distribution to the recipient; and
 *
 *      b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
 *         or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
 *         the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
 *         rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 *
 * 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 *
 *      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 *      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
 *      Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
 *      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
 *      Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
 *      You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
 *      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
 *      their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
 *      either this License or such Secondary License(s).
 *
 * 3.4. Notices
 *
 *      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
 *      copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
 *      of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
 *      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
 *      required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 *
 * 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 *
 *      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 *      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 *      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
 *      of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
 *      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
 *      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 *      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 *      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 *      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 *      jurisdiction.
 *
 * 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 *
 *    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 *    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
 *    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
 *    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
 *    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
 *    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
 *    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 *    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 *    understand it.
 *
 * 5. Termination
 *
 * 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
 *      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
 *      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
 *      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
 *      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
 *      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
 *      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
 *      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
 *      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
 *      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
 *      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
 *      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
 *
 * 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 *      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
 *      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
 *      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
 *      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
 *      shall terminate.
 *
 * 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
 *      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
 *      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
 *      termination shall survive termination.
 *
 * 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
 *
 *    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
 *    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
 *    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
 *    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
 *    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
 *    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
 *    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
 *    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
 *    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
 *    except under this disclaimer.
 *
 * 7. Limitation of Liability
 *
 *    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
 *    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
 *    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
 *    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
 *    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
 *    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
 *    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
 *    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
 *    party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
 *    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
 *    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
 *
 * 8. Litigation
 *
 *    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
 *    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
 *    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
 *    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
 *    prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
 *
 * 9. Miscellaneous
 *
 *    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
 *    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 *    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 *    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
 *    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
 *    this License against a Contributor.
 *
 *
 * 10. Versions of the License
 *
 * 10.1. New Versions
 *
 *       Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
 *       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 *       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 *       distinguishing version number.
 *
 * 10.2. Effect of New Versions
 *
 *       You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
 *       the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
 *       under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
 *       steward.
 *
 * 10.3. Modified Versions
 *
 *       If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
 *       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
 *       version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
 *       references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
 *       modified license differs from this License).
 *
 * 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
 *       If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
 *       Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
 *       notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
 *
 * Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
 *
 *       This Source Code Form is subject to the
 *       terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
 *       2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
 *       distributed with this file, You can
 *       obtain one at
 *       http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
 *
 * If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
 * You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
 * directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.
 *
 * You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
 *
 * Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice
 *
 *       This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
 *       With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
